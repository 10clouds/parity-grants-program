# A better treasury system

# Project Overview üìÑ

This project is a response to an informal request by the Web3 Foundation, based on activities in the community (Link to forum: [https://forum.polkadot.network/t/a-better-treasury-system/291/21?u=david](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/a-better-treasury-system/291/21?u=david) )

## Overview

The goal of this project is a thorough analysis of the treasury process and the associated tools in terms of user experience to improve the overall experience of the treasury system and better understand community needs.

\
Users in the forum describe a wide range of design improvement needs across the entire user journey (link: [https://forum.polkadot.network/t/a-better-treasury-system/291/21?u=david](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/a-better-treasury-system/291/21?u=david) ). \
The areas they indicate concern a wide range of services, from communication to technical solutions. Due to the number and variety of the issues mentioned, it is impossible to correctly prioritize the actions taken without taking into account the community in the process. \
 \
Our project aims to thoroughly analyze not only the mentioned problems but also the full user path, in order to highlight the list of issues necessary to solve in order to improve the usability of the solution. This action will be based on close cooperation with the community, allowing to better understand their needs, motivations, and goals. \
 \
Due to the active involvement of the community, the project will additionally have a positive impact on the overall perception of the solution (the feeling of really listening to the voice of users in order to improve the solution). \
 \
In addition to delivering the action roadmap, the team will provide a full list of recommendations for each of the noticed problems, a solution for the jointly selected issue, and user analytics data (which may support other activities, including marketing). It will allow getting a consistent picture of the target user journey, ensuring that even if improvement work will be carried out in batches (or by other teams), it will be possible to achieve a consistent and positive user experience throughout the whole process.

We also want to show a specific example of how the conclusions should be used and the research process conducted with the involvement of recipients. For this purpose, our project team will design, in cooperation with the community, a solution to the selected problem, along with testing it with users.

## Project Details

Due to the research ‚Äì design nature of the work, we are able to clearly define what type of materials will be delivered, but the design work will directly result from the research phase. \
 \
The final result of the work will be:

- a full set of information on the user's needs and problems along the entire user path (both from analyses and research with recipients)

- descriptions of users' personas, allowing both for a better understanding of the needs in the design phase, as well as for use in other areas of activity (communication, marketing)

- written recommendations regarding solutions to the observed problems (with an indication of priorities and implementation details)

- solving a utility problem selected together with users in the form of designing mockups & UI components. The detailed appearance of the screens will be possible to determine only after conducting the analysis and jointly selecting the problem to be solved

- a full report from the research actions & insight, that can be used in other projects as a knowledge base about the users

A detailed description of deliverables can be found later in the document in the development roadmap section.

## Ecosystem Fit

We distinguish a division into two main target groups, depending on the use of the insights.

The first one is the entire community in connection with the goal of improving the treasure system and the possibility of implementing solutions that really respond to their needs.

The second of them is all people working on improving the solution, related to the communication, design, and development part. Due to the fact that the result of the analysis will be a full review of the prioritized problems to be solved in order to improve the user journey, it will be possible to distribute tasks between different teams. Apart from information about the problem, they will receive a recommendation in which direction its solution should be developed so that the entire process path was useful and consistent (even when different teams work on it)

# Development Status üìñ

At the moment, the project team has analyzed the forum entries related to the discussed topic and checked the initial analysis of the utility paths as part of the preparatory exploration to determine the shape of the project.

In addition, based on a quick market review, we determined the initial range of values ‚Äã‚Äãwith a wide range of competitors (not only direct ones) and began analyzing crypto solutions for wider initial exploration (solutions that are not direct competition). Link to the sheet:

# Future Plans

The main part of the final effect of the project work will be the development of a long-term work plan aimed at improving the usability of the entire solution path. It will be guidelines for other teams to choose the area of work on improving the application. We also plan to support the improvement of the process by solving highlighted problems by our design and development teams. We will start this process during the project by designing a solution of the selected problem, and we want to continue it in the future in term of developing it (and solving other issues).
